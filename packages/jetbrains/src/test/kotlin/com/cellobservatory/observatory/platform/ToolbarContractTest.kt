 * This exists because of a defect no other test in this repo could have caught: every toolbar on the
 * Overview was bound to `targetComponent = fleetTree`, a component that lives inside ONE nav tab. The
 * platform refuses to perform an action whose toolbar target is not showing, so with any other tab
 * selected — Sessions is the default — every button on that panel silently did nothing. It compiled, the
 * unit tests passed, CI was green, and the only evidence was a line in the IDE's own log.

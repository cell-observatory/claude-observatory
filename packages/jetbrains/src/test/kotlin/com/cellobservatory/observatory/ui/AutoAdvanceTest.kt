/**
 * `revealNextOnResolve`: after ONE keep/undo the review cursor moves to the next pending edit — and after
 * a REDO it must not, because VS Code does not advance there and a silent divergence between the two
 * editors is exactly the class of defect the parity rule exists for.
 *
 * The redo assertion is the point of this file, so it comes with a positive control: the same call with
 * `redo = false` must actually move the cursor. Without that, a gate that rejected everything would look
 * like a passing redo test forever.

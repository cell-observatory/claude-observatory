/**
 * The Overview nav's Active-only / Clear-completed DISPLAY classification — the Kotlin port of the ONE
 * pure `multitaskFilter` the VS Code webview embeds verbatim (extension.ts). Extracted to `model/` so
 * the panel can't drift from the canonical rule, and pinned by MultitaskFilterTest against the SAME
 * fixture payload the VS Code smoke test drives:
 *   · an agent is ACTIVE when its own phase is working/awaiting-input/awaiting-permission, OR any of
 *     its subagents is (a live subagent promotes an idle parent);
 *   · a workflow is active while `running`;
 *   · a dismissed (Clear-completed) item hides ONLY while inactive — it reappears the moment it goes
 *     active again.

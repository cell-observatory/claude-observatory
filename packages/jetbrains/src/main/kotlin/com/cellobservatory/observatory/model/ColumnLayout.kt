/**
 * The rules a group of side-by-side columns follows: which of them show content, which are folded to a
 * rail, how wide each divider sits, and when the group must stack instead of shrinking.
 *
 * Pure data, away from Swing, for the same reason [NavGrouping] is: these are the decisions that go wrong
 * silently. A fold that empties a group, a divider that resets the width the reader dragged, a column
 * arriving late and taking its siblings' widths with it — none of those throw, none fail a build, and all
 * of them read to a user as "the panel moved my stuff". They are asserted in ColumnLayoutTest instead.
 *
 * Both grouped surfaces use it: the Overview's nav groups and the Timeline's Prompts · Observations ·
 * Actions. One rule set, two renderers ([com.cellobservatory.observatory.ui.ColumnGroupPane] is the only
 * one — the windows share it).

# ci-local — run what CI runs, on the PLATFORM CI runs it on, before pushing.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# --------------
# `npm test` on a Mac is not a green build. PR #50 went red on Linux/node 20 with an `ENOTDIR` that
# macOS reports as `ENOENT` and therefore swallows: `fs.statSync(p, { throwIfNoEntry: false })`
# suppresses ENOENT only, so a path whose component is a FILE rather than a directory throws on Linux
# and does not on a Mac. The test covering that case was green here and red there, and no amount of
# re-running it locally would have said so. Only the platform could.
#
# So this runs the Linux lanes in a container, across CI's Node matrix, plus the native-platform lanes
# directly. It is the pre-push gate; `npm test` is not.
#
#   bash scripts/ci-local.sh            # the whole matrix
#   bash scripts/ci-local.sh --quick    # Linux on the oldest Node only — the lane that catches most
#   bash scripts/ci-local.sh --native   # skip containers; local platform only
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT DO: Windows. There is no container for it on macOS, so the windows-latest lanes are
# still only checked by CI — write those tests to be platform-independent (stub the platform) rather
# than hoping. The same rule applies to any bug that turns out to be OS-specific: reproduce it
# everywhere, or a contributor on the other OS cannot run it before pushing.
